I used some things that were not explained yet in the book, but I think it's worth 
you to search it. What I used was the library fstream, that allows us to read
data from an external file, it's really helpfull instead of writing 1000 lines of
input in the console. And I used another library, ctime, that allow us to know
how much time the program took to run. This facility I found in the explanation 
of http://mathalope.co.uk/2014/08/27/accelerated-c-solution-to-exercise-5-2/,
it's a really good site, there's all the Accelerated C++ exercises.

To use my program, just comment the main function you don't want to use, depending
on wich test you want to make, if it is with vector or list. Comment the functions
as well. And just copy/paste the lines in "data.txt" until you get the amount of
lines you want for your test.

This is a really nice program!
