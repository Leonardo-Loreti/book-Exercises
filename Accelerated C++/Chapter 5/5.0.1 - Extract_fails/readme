There are disposed in these files, all the programs discussed in the chapter 5 of the book. In order to run it, we have to comment all the programs we will not use, obviously.

I didn't use the program made in the exercise 4.0, instead of it, I used a much more simpler program, because I believe the goal of this exercise, is to get used with the different containers we can use, wich one fits better for an specific application, and some tools to use them, like iterators instead of indexes.
